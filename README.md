# Notes
* Compatibility is set to 5.1+ as, since there were no requirements on the matter, I understood that I could make use of the whole Android toolset available to date without worrying about the restrictions that this imposes on the size of the target userbase.

The buildscript describes only the debug buildType; a specific release binary is not built as no keys were provided nor usage of ProGuard was mentioned in the requirements.
