# Notes
* The wireframes were a bit confusing as for how to show the loading progressbar, as the screenshot was showing it on the center while the PDF was doing so next to the sorting button. I decided to take the approach of the currently standard interaction: a swipe-to-refresh list.

The buildscript describes only the debug buildType; a specific release binary is not built as no keys were provided nor usage of ProGuard was mentioned in the requirements.
